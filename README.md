==================================

Test Project: VotableComments using the Meteor JS Framework

This is just a test of the Meteor Framework (http://meteor.com). 
It's cool to play around with it and it's amazing how few code is needed to produce
a small web app. 

But: So far, I've failed to define models ...

## Setup

```bash
cd ~/meteor
curl install.meteor.com | sh
git clone https://github.com/fiedl/votable_comments_test_using_meteor.git
cd votable_comments_test_using_meteor
meteor # this runs the server
```

Now visit http://localhost:3000.
